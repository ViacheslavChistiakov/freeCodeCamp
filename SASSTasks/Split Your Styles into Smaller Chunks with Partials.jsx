/*DESCRIPTIONâš¡
Note that the underscore and file extension are not needed in the import statement - Sass understands it is a partial. Once a partial is imported into a file, all variables, mixins, and other code are available to use.

Write an @import statement to import a partial named _variables.scss into the main.scss file.

{/* <>
<!-- The main.scss file -->
@import 'variables'

</> */}
