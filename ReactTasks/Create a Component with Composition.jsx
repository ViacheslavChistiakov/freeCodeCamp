/*DESCRIPTION⚡
Note: ChildComponent is defined with an ES6 arrow function because this is a very common practice when using React.

In the code editor, there is a simple functional component called ChildComponent and a class component called ParentComponent. Compose the two together by rendering the ChildComponent within the ParentComponent. Make sure to close the ChildComponent tag with a forward slash.

const ChildComponent = () => {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>I am the child</p>
      </div>
    );
  };
  
  class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
    }
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>I am the parent</h1>
          { /* Change code below this line */ }
            <ChildComponent />
  
          { /* Change code above this line */ }
        </div>
      );
    }
  };
