Note: The componentWillMount Lifecycle method will be deprecated in a future version of 16.X and removed in version 17. Learn more in this article

The componentWillMount() method is called before the render() method when a component is being mounted to the DOM. Log something to the console within componentWillMount() - you may want to have your browser console open to see the output.
